## ⚠️ Finance / Investment - NEEDS ENHANCEMENT

**Current Fields:**
- FINRA Number
- SEC Number
- License Number
- Credentials (CFA, CFP)
- Firm Name

**Issues Found:**
1. **Missing CRD Number** - Central Registration Depository number is more commonly used than generic "FINRA Number"
2. **Disclaimer needs to be more specific** - Should include:
   - "Securities offered through [Broker-Dealer Name], Member FINRA/SIPC"
   - "Investment advisory services offered through [RIA Name]"
   - Clarification if insurance products are offered

**Recommended Updates:**
- Change "FINRA Number" to "CRD Number" (more accurate)

- Enhance disclaimer template with regulatory language
